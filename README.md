-   dataset: https://recsys.eb.dk/
-   baseline repository: https://github.com/ebanalyse/ebnerd-benchmark/blob/main/examples/00_quick_start/nrms_ebnerd.ipynb
-   gru baseline from "recommenders" project:

    -   code: https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/recommenders/models/deeprec/models/sequential/gru.py

_steps:_

-   download dataset ✅
-   register organization on "codabench" ✅
-   write code:
    -   the baseline from the "ebnerd-benchmark" projects ✅
    -   the "baseline" model from the "recommenders" project → not reproducible, no docs. wrote from scratch in pytorch ✅
    -   the "gru" model from the "recommenders" project
    -   one algorithm of choice
-   improve (check out the "ebnerd-benchmark" project for ideas)
-   test
-   write report pdf
-   submit to "codabench"
-   submit to gitlab, add "final" tag
-   upload project report pdf
