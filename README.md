steps:

-   download dataset → chunked and added to this repository
-   register organization on "codabench" → waiting for team
-   implement:
    -   baseline from the "ebnerd-benchmark" projects
    -   the "gru" model from the "recommenders" project
    -   one algorithm of choice
-   optimize
-   test
-   write report
-   submit to "codabench"
