_steps:_

-   register group and algorithm on tuwel, register organization on "codabench" ✅
-   download dataset ✅

-   implement 3 algorithms:

    -   baseline model from the repository "NRMS on EB-NeRD" from "ebnerd-benchmark"
    -   "gru" from "recommenders"
    -   algorithm of choice

-   improve: check out "beyond metrics" section in the "ebnerd-benchmark" repository
-   write report pdf
-   submit to "codabench"
-   submit to gitlab, add "final" tag
-   upload project report pdf
